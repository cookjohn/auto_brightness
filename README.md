# auto_brightness
很多笔记本电脑没有光线传感器，无法自动调节屏幕亮度。白天阳光充足时屏幕看不清，晚上关灯后又刺眼。每次都要手动调节，非常麻烦。 但其实，笔记本自带的摄像头就能感知环境光线。于是我写了这个脚本，让摄像头充当光线传感器，实现零成本的自动亮度调节。  使用非常简单。它会定时用摄像头拍一张照片，分析环境亮度，然后自动调整屏幕亮度。检测完立即关闭摄像头，不会持续占用。 它还有学习功能。进入学习模式后，在最暗和最亮的环境下分别按一下键，脚本就会记住你的环境光范围，之后的调节会更加精准。 你还可以调整亮度比值，控制屏幕亮度的敏感程度。所有设置都会自动保存，下次启动直接生效。 
The Problem 
Many laptops don't have an ambient light sensor, so they can't adjust screen brightness automatically. During the day, the screen is too dim to see. At night, it's painfully bright. Manually adjusting brightness every time is annoying. But here's the thing — your laptop already has a camera that can sense light. So I wrote a Python script that turns your webcam into a light sensor. Zero extra hardware needed.
How It Works
Just run the script, and it periodically captures a frame from your camera, analyzes the ambient light, and adjusts your screen brightness accordingly. The camera closes immediately after each check — no constant recording. It also has a learning mode. Go to your darkest and brightest environments, press a key in each, and the script learns your light range for more accurate adjustments. You can fine-tune the brightness ratio to match your personal preference. All settings are saved automatically and persist across restarts. Set it to run at startup, and your laptop will manage brightness just like your phone does — silently and seamlessly.
